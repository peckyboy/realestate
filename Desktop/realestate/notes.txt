to make an auth:
php artisan ui:auth

in the app/http/controllers/auth/registercontroller.php you'd see a validator function that is used to validate the input from the backend. its an array of things tha must be passed
if you modify that controller, you have to modify the database/migrations/create_users_table to reflect the modification

you can interact with your app with tinker in the command prompt:
    php artisan tinker
in the tinker:
User::all()//where user is the name returned in the registercontroller and the file is in app/User (which is the model). all() gets all the users in the table
if u make mods to the user table and the registercontroller, you have to run php artisan migrate:fresh to refresh the db and then go to the model add add/modify the necessary


larvel has what is called restful controllers:
Verb	    Path	            Action	    Route Name
GET	        /photo	            index	    photo.index
GET	        /photo/create	    create	    photo.create
POST	    /photo	            store	    photo.store
GET	        /photo/{photo}	    show	    photo.show
GET	        /photo/{photo}/edit	edit	    photo.edit
PUT/PATCH	/photo/{photo}	    update	    photo.update
DELETE	    /photo/{photo}	    destroy	    photo.destroy

to make controller: 
    php artisan make:controller NameofController
...this creates the above table,then it can be registered in the routes as:
    Route::('route', NameofController) or specify only certain actions
    Route::resource('photo', 'PhotoController',['only' => ['index', 'show']]);

    Route::resource('photo', 'PhotoController',['except' => ['create', 'store', 'update', 'destroy']]);

the dd($var); function is die() in controllers

to look for a val in the db,
User::find($var)//this searches by the id...returns null if not found

you can create a model with: 
    php artisan make:model Profile -m 
the -m is for migration

in the created table migration, add the fields u wanna include then run:
    php artisan migrate
this creates the table.
